Reconmap is compatible with all recent versions of modern web browsers across all major operating systems. However, for optimal **security**, **performance**, and **supportability**, we recommend using the latest **stable**[^stable] release of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/).

While other browsers may function correctly, they may not offer the best experience or full compatibility.

We regularly test Reconmap on the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox to ensure consistent performance.

To check whether your browser is up to date, visit one of the following resources:

- <https://browser-update.org/browsers.html>
- <http://browsers.fyi>

[^stable]: **Note:** "Stable" refers to official public releases, excluding beta, nightly, or canary versions.
