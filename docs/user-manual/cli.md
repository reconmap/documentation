There is a large number of commands a pentester needs to execute as part of their security tasks, but keeping track of these commands and their arguments is not always easy. Moreover, analysing the results of these commands can be a time-consuming task. Reconmap offers a CLI (Command line interface) that allows the user to quickly find commands saved in the database and automatically execute them, uploading the results to the server for further analysis and reporting.

Up to date information on how to use the CLI can be found on [this README file](https://github.com/reconmap/cli/blob/master/README.md).
