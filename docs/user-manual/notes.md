Notes are comments that you can leave at the engagement (project) or vulnerability levels. They can contain useful information for other people in your team using Reconmap or for the user. The notes that are public are included automatically in the pentest report, whereas the private ones are excluded from it.

You can access the project notes by visiting the project's page, then clicking on the **Notes** tab.
