Reconmap simplifies by creation of pentest reports with the use of customisable templates. It comes with a pre-defined pentest report template but you can change styles, cover, header and footer, as well as deciding which options to include or exclude from the report.

You can find an example of template [here](https://github.com/reconmap/rest-api/blob/master/resources/templates/reports/default.docx) and the documentation of the templating engine [here](https://phpword.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates-processing.html).
