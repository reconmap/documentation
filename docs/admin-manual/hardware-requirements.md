Reconmap is optimised to run efficiently even on low specs devices. The minimum and recommended hardware requirements to run the whole software are:

| Component | Minimum requirements | Recommended requirements |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| CPU       | 1 core               | 4 cores                  |
| RAM       | 1 GB                 | 4 GB                     |
| Disk      | 25 GB                | 50GB SSD                 |

Considering the minimum requirements above you could install Reconmap on an cheap 5USD droplet in Digital Ocean, altough better specs would bring you and your team increased performance.
