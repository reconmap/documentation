The docker images provided by Reconmap come with some pre-defined limits that we consider reasonable for most of the use cases we have encounter. Some of the limits can be found below:

| File           | Max upload size |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Attachment     | 20MB            |
| Command output | 10MB            |
